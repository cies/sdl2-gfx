# sdl2-gfx

Haskell bindings to
[SDL2_gfx](http://www.ferzkopp.net/joomla/content/view/19/14/) which provides
"graphics drawing primitives and other support functions".

To be used with the [Haskell bindings to SDL2](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sdl2) named `sdl2`.

In the `old-but-complete/` directory you find the bindings as they were in [joelburget's package](https://github.com/joelburget/sdl2-gfx), which builds on the `SDL2` (notice the all-caps spelling) bindings.

Currently this package is not nearly as complete, but compatible with the newer `sdl2` (notice the lower case spalling package.
